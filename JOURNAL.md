## 10/12/2025 - Finished the CAD for the cyclodial drive  

I finished the CAD for the drive, and now I'm waiting for the 3D print from the library. So far, I have a test print with the cycloidal drive and it works fine.

The cycloidal drive will have a 26:1 gear ratio providing ~11.2N torque with a 150mm arm length, assuming 20% efficiency. This is greater than the expected load of ~9.04N.

Torque results:

Current circuit (I'll create a custom PCB later):

Power: 12V 3A
Motor: NEMA 17
Motor Driver: DRV8825

Also, I researched about inverse kinematics and found a library that I'll use and created a quick .urdf for it.  

## 10/16/2025 - Received prints + fixed CAD  

I received the print from the library!

There were a few problems with it, but I got it running, and I worked on fixing those problems in CAD, and designing the arm.

The issues include:
- Input shaft being very, very hard to put on
- The base not aligning with center "bump" on motor
- Rotors wearing out

^ updated cycloidal drive with space for balsa wood


Next up, I'll print the updated files and test the torque.

Torque _might_ be a problem, so I want to test that ASAP.  

## 10/18/2025 - Worked on CAD assembly  

I completed the FULL CAD assembly for the 2 arms, the only thing left to CAD now is the base! I sent the updated CAD files to the library and I'm waiting for them to be done to test them out. 

The assembly looks SICK!

While building, I found 2 potential problems:

- The center of gravity IS NOT directly on top of the base
- Wires will twist


For now, I'll ignore the 2nd problem and focus on the 1st one. I'll also ask my engineering teacher his thoughts on Monday.  

## 10/23/2025 - I got the 3D prints, however...  

This is a quick update, 

I got the 3D prints from another library this time, and the tolerances were all off.  

Lesson learned: I'm getting all my prints from one library moving forward.  

The new prints should be ready in about 3 days.
